This is a HTML/CSS project, named based off the assigned user story-

```
"AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines"
```

(The mock marketing agency referenced is Horiseon Social Solution Services.)

Since Junior developers are often tasked with reworking code to meet specific criteria, this challenge gave us the opportunity to think of ways to improve a code based on the outlined tasks. Following the Acceptance Criteria and Mockup-

```
"GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title"
```

To complete this, I pulled source code from [Course Repo](https://github.com/the-Coding-Boot-Camp-at-UT/UTA-VIRT-BO-FSF-PT-12-2021-U-B), reviewed and added semantic elements to the HTML. Updates include alt text next to the images as descriptions for audio listeners. I restructured the stylesheet to group similar elements and included comments for easier access/understanding for future development. Lastly, I fixed the broken link to "Search Engine Optimization".
